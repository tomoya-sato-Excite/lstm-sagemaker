# This is a Python 3 image that uses the nginx, gunicorn, flask stack
# for serving inferences in a stable way.

# Here we get all python packages.

# linking them together. Likewise, pip leaves the install caches populated which uses
# a significant amount of space. These optimizations save a fair amount of space in the
# image, which reduces start up time.

# Set some environment variables. PYTHONUNBUFFERED keeps Python from buffering our standard

# keeps Python from writing the .pyc files which are unnecessary in this case. We also update
# PATH so that the train and serve programs are found when the container is invoked.
